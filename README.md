# Parking-intelligent-project
Our project consists of a connected car park that manages spaces in a flexible and intelligent way. They offer the user the possibility of keeping his car in a secure place on the one hand, and being able to reserve a remote location for his vehicle on the other hand. All this through a graphical interface to be designed so that the user can access it by computer or telephone.

# Main functions :

PF1: Car park entrance management.
PF2: Car park exit management.
PF3: Management of parking spaces.
PF4: Server management and interface.

Here is the following table detailing the four functions :
